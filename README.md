# Rawson JS Test

## Instructions

Please review these carefully, both the final submitted code & how well these instructions are followed will be taken into consideration.

Your task is to create a view of Reddit's front-page using the following endpoint: [https://reddit.com/.json](https://reddit.com/.json).
Use any Javascript framework you are comfortable in.

* Clone this repository (Yes it's empty - but it's also a clean slate for you to shine!), then create your own public repository and set that as the remote (see: `git remote set-url`). This is so that other's can't see your work as they would if you were to fork the repository.
* Add at least 1 test assertion using Jest or Mocha as the test framework.
* Don't worry about styling, though if you'd like to you can use Bootstrap.
* Including some features like being able to expand a post's body content inline, see the votes or awards.
* Include EsLint, and set your own specifications to help you lint your code.
* Give yourself approx. 4 hours to complete the task. But you have until Monday the 20th to submit it :).

## How I expect to setup and run the project once completed:
```
npm install
npm run serve
```


## Frameworks that will score you bonus points:

- Vue 2/3
